# Graph Coloring

This code is a project for the discipline Analysis and Project of Algorithms, in the Federal University of Paraiba, Brazil.

## Introduction to the problem

In the Graph Coloring problem, we aim to color the verticies of a graph, in a way that two vertices of the same color are not adjacent to each other. Using the minimum number of colors possible.

## Solutions implemented

* **Greedy Coloring**
* **VND**
* **DSATUR**


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
G++ or compatible installed.
```

### Installing

To run the code in LINUX, in the directoy file:

```
make
```

And next:

```
./Build/Graphcoloring
```

## Change input graph

There is a directory called inputs with a number of graphs to test, to change the graph that's going to be colored, in /Source/graph.cpp , on Graph::Graph():

```
adjacent_matrix = ReadFile("inputs/input-name.col", &vertex_number);
```
With **input-name** being the name of the .col input to be tested.
